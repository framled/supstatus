# SUP Safety & Conditions Rationale

This document outlines the safety thresholds used in the Chile SUP Weather Dashboard to categorize suitability levels for Stand Up Paddleboarding. These values are derived from industry standards and safety guidelines to ensure paddlers are matched with conditions appropriate for their skill level.

## Suitability Levels & Thresholds

### 1. Junior (Beginner)
**Target**: First-time paddlers or those still learning balance and basic steering.

*   **Wind Threshold**: ≤ 8 knots (~9 mph)
*   **Wave Threshold**: ≤ 0.3 meters (~1 ft)

**Rationale**:
*   **Wind**: Beginners struggle to paddle against the wind. Winds exceeding 8-10 knots can quickly blow a paddler offshore or make it physically impossible to return to the start point ("treadmill effect"). Calm conditions (<5 kn) are ideal for learning.
*   **Waves**: Flat water is essential for building core stability. Even small chops (wind waves) can cause frequent falls and fatigue for novices. 0.3m allows for tiny ripples but ensures no breaking lines.

### 2. Intermediate
**Target**: Paddlers with solid balance, efficient stroke technique, and self-rescue skills.

*   **Wind Threshold**: ≤ 15 knots (~17 mph)
*   **Wave Threshold**: ≤ 1.0 meters (~3 ft)

**Rationale**:
*   **Wind**: Intermediate paddlers can maintain forward momentum against a moderate breeze. However, winds above 15 knots introduce significant chop and drift risks that require advanced stamina and course-correction skills.
*   **Waves**: Capable of negotiating small ocean swells and choppier water. 1 meter implies manageable conditions where balance is challenged but manageable.

### 3. Senior (Advanced)
**Target**: Expert paddlers comfortable in open ocean, downwinding, and surf environments.

*   **Wind Threshold**: > 15 knots
*   **Wave Threshold**: > 1.0 meters

**Rationale**:
*   **Wind**: Strong winds (20+ knots) are often sought after by advanced riders for "downwinding" (surfing wind swells). However, these conditions require expert self-rescue capabilities and knowledge of local currents.
*   **Waves**: Large swells (overhead or near-overhead) pose risks of being held under, leash snaps, or equipment damage. Only experienced watermen/women should attempt these conditions.

## Safety Warning
**Always check local warnings.** These thresholds are general guidelines. Local geography (cliffs, currents, tides) can significantly amplify the danger of wind and waves.
*   **Offshore Winds**: Never paddle alone in offshore winds (blowing from land to sea), regardless of skill level.
*   **Cold Water**: In Chile, hypothermia is a major risk. Always wear a wetsuit.
